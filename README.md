This is meant to test one function at a time with the results represented in the html, meant for use with a local server, or the "Live Server" extension in VS Code. What the function returns will be displayed on the web page. This makes testing a function more streamlined as you don't need to open dev tools and look at the console.

If you choose to use the "Live Server" extenstion, the return of the function will be displayed on the page immediately upon saving the js file changes, making it even more streamlined, as with a local server you need to refresh the page to see the changes.
